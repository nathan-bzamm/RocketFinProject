# RocketFinProject Repository Overview

This repository contains two versions of the InvestoPro stock portfolio management application:

1. **stock-application**: The original version built using **JavaScript**.
2. **stock-application-typescript**: The enhanced version built using **TypeScript**.

## Why Two Versions?

### 1. **stock-application (JavaScript)**
The initial implementation of InvestoPro was created using JavaScript to provide a fast and functional prototype of the stock portfolio management tool. This version was built to:

- Quickly validate the concept and functionality of the app.
- Utilize JavaScriptâ€™s flexibility for rapid development and testing.
- Meet the core requirements for managing and tracking stock portfolios.

### 2. **stock-application-typescript (TypeScript)**
Following the successful implementation of the JavaScript version, a TypeScript version was developed to improve the codebase by adding:

- **Type Safety**: Helps catch errors during development and prevents many runtime issues.
- **Maintainability**: Clear type annotations make the code easier to read and maintain, especially as the application scales.
- **Scalability**: TypeScript is better suited for larger projects, where strict type-checking ensures consistency and reduces bugs.

## Folder Structure

- **stock-application/**: Contains the complete JavaScript version of InvestoPro.
- **stock-application-typescript/**: Contains the complete TypeScript version of InvestoPro, including type definitions and enhanced code structure.
